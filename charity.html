          <p>The Pacific leatherback is the world's most endangered marine turtle population. The greatest threat to leatherback sea turtles is from incidental take in commercial fisheries and marine pollution (such as balloons and plastic bags floating in the water, which are mistaken for jellyfish).</p>
